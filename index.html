                <p>The website is intended as a didactic tool for the audiences to gain knowledge and information
                    about the unique ecosystems and wildlife Queensland has on display. The goal is to make people more
                    aware of these animals, information like their features, habitat and their current conservation
                    status. By using API sources from the Queensland Government we could build a more emmersive user

                    for target audiences.</p>
